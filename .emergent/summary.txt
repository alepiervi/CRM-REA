The trajectory chronicles an intensive period of bug fixing and feature enhancement on an Italian CRM. Initially, the AI engineer resolved an issue where client filter options displayed user-created contract types by refining the backend  endpoint. A major recurring theme was data integrity, necessitating manual database seeding to address empty collections and ensure cascading selectors functioned across various commesse. The  was entirely implemented, followed by extensive authorization work across multiple user roles. This included adding missing roles to backend enums, configuring  permissions, correcting frontend role recognition in , and fixing UI visibility for the Clienti section. A critical security vulnerability was addressed, limiting advanced filter data exposure for specialized roles. The Excel export function was refined from CSV to XLSX, incorporating missing filiera data. The AI demonstrated meticulous troubleshooting, often with the  and automated testing, to diagnose and resolve complex, interdependent issues, including persistent frontend/backend mismatches and UI rendering bugs. The work concluded with the AI implementing full client section functionality for  and , integrating them into existing backend filter and authorization logic.

<product_requirements>
The application functions as an internal CRM for managing clients and projects (Commesse).
1.  **Client Management**: Users can create, view, and manage clients. This includes robust dynamic client search filters (Sub Agenzia, Tipologia Contratto, Status, Utente Creatore) displaying all available system-wide options, not just those linked to existing clients. A multi-step cascading selection filiera (Sub Agenzia -> Commessa -> Servizio -> Tipologia Contratto -> Segmento -> Offerta) is essential for new client creation, dynamically populating based on user roles and authorized data. Excel export of client lists must be in  format and include full filiera data.
2.  **Document Management with Aruba Drive**: The system uploads client documents to Aruba Drive, manages credentials, creates hierarchical folder structures, and provides inline document viewing.
3.  **UI/UX & Session Stability**: Ensures reliable navigation, stable user sessions, and correct UI visibility for various user roles, including addressing Non autorizzato messages.
4.  **User Role & Authorization**: Granular role-based access control is paramount. Specific user roles (Admin, Responsabile Commessa, BackOffice Commessa, Responsabile Sub Agenzia, BackOffice Sub Agenzia, Agente Specializzato, Operatore, Responsabile Store, Responsabile Presidi, Store Assist, Promoter Presidi) must have distinct permissions for viewing, creating, and filtering client data, with strict data privacy (e.g., only seeing own data in filters). Creation of all defined user roles must be functional.

    -   **Importance**: This file handles the entire React application's UI, state, and API interactions, including complex forms, dynamic selectors, and role-based UI rendering.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  ****: Fully implemented a new modal for client creation (around line 16700), including state management for cascading selections.
        2.  **Role-Based Flow ()**:
            *   Corrected role string comparisons (e.g.,  to ) (line 15331).
            *   Ensured  and new roles (e.g., , ) correctly initiate the  flow ( call added at line 15356, and logic at line 15321).
            *   Modified logic (around line 15308) to prioritize role detection over  presence, resolving incorrect flow initialization for  and .
        3.  **Cascading Selectors UI**: Adjusted visibility conditions for  (line 15797) and  dropdowns to correctly display for  and .
        4.  **UI Authorization**: Expanded access control for the Clienti section (line 1722) to include , , , , and .
        5.  **Data Mapping**: Enhanced  (line 15218) with  for robust string-to-enum conversion, resolving 422 errors.
        6.  **User Form**: Corrected role name  to  (e.g., line 3864).
        7.  **Excel Export**: The  function (around line 13080) was modified to call the backend Excel endpoint (), replacing its previous CSV generation logic.

    -   **Importance**: This file defines all FastAPI endpoints, database models, business logic, and authorization rules.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  **Client Filter Options ()**:
            *   Refactored to dynamically fetch unique filter options from primary database collections, removing hardcoded fictitious data and combining data from existing clients (around lines 8915-8924).
            *   Corrected  logic (line 8956) to filter by  instead of .
            *   **Security Fix**: Implemented role-based filtering for , , , and  roles (lines 8911-8912, 8962-8964, 8971-8974) to limit visibility to only their associated data.
        2.  **Cascading Endpoints**:
            *   Added new  endpoint (around line 12970).
            *   Modified  to filter services based on  rather than showing all services for a .
            *   Updated services in MongoDB to populate  arrays for correct cascade functionality.
        3.  **User Role Management**: Added missing enum values for , , ,  to  (lines 130-149).
        4.  **Client Authorization (, )**:

            *   Added explicit authorization for Store/Presidi roles for client viewing (lines 8753-8756).
        5.  **Excel Export ()**: Added Offerta to headers (line 8816) and implemented logic to fetch and include  in the exported data (around line 9118).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the final stages of implementing the full Clienti section functionality for the  and  user roles. This includes ensuring they have proper authorization for viewing and filtering clients, aligning with the logic already established for roles like .

Specifically, the AI has confirmed that these roles already have the necessary backend logic for  (viewing clients). The main focus is now on the  endpoint in  to ensure their advanced filters function correctly and securely. The AI has already:
1.  Explicitly included  and  in the general role-based filtering logic for client filter options (around lines 8911-8912).
2.  Added specific filtering logic for these roles when retrieving users and sub-agencies for the filter dropdowns, ensuring they only see data associated with their  (around lines 8962-8964 and 8971-8974).

At the immediate end of the trajectory, the AI is in the process of adding these roles to the  within the  endpoint (at line 632 in ) to fully complete the backend aspect of their filter authorizations. The user has explicitly requested to perform manual frontend testing for these roles once the backend work is done.
