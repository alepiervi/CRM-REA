The AI engineer's work on the Nureal CRM was highly iterative, driven by continuous user feedback across several complex features. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical frontend issues, specifically an  in  by correctly refactoring  placements. This paved the way for a major UI/UX enhancement of the entire Analytics section, standardizing its look and feel.

Subsequently, the engineer implemented robust, multi-layered role-based access controls for Analytics, Clienti, and Sub Agenzie sections. This involved extensive modifications to both frontend UI rendering (sidebar and tab visibility) and backend API filtering logic, ensuring data authorization based on user roles, , and . Granular permissions were also introduced for client status management, modification, and deletion, including an Inserito/Ko status lock and a default status for new clients. Document upload was made universally permissible.

A cyclical 90-day password expiration policy was integrated for non-admin users. The most recent challenge involved debugging deployment failures, which revealed an empty production database after deployment, causing critical data (commesse, filiera) to be missing. The engineer is now tasked with addressing this data gap, likely through a seeding mechanism.

<product_requirements>
The Nureal CRM aims for comprehensive client and project management. Key functionalities include a multi-step cascading client creation form with conditional fields (e.g., Dati Mobile for Mobile contracts, Telepass with an OBU field), and robust role-based access. Client data must be exportable to Excel, with each SIM (convergenza or mobile) as a separate row, including all client fields and offer names. Client modification should mirror creation, displaying all fields, making organizational data read-only, showing activated offers, including Note Back Office, full credit card numbers, and updated statuses. Offerte must be dynamic and link to the filiera.

Recent additions include:
- Enhanced Convergenza SIM data display in .
- Dati Mobile and Telepass sections, mutually exclusive with Telefonia Fastweb.
- Redefined client list columns and dynamic advanced filters.
- A new Analytics section with Pivot Analytics and Sub Agenzie comparative analysis, with improved UI.
- Access to Analytics (Pivot and Sub Agenzie) for Responsabile Commessa, Backoffice Commessa, Responsabile Sub Agenzia, Backoffice Sub Agenzia, and Area Manager, with filtered data.
- Filters in Clienti, Analytics, and Dashboard must only show Sub Agenzie/Clients with *both* authorized commessa *and* authorized services.
- Default client creation status Passata al BO. Only Backoffice Commessa can modify client statuses. Modification/deletion is blocked if status is Inserito or Ko (except for Backoffice Commessa).
- All users can upload documents regardless of client status.
- Non-admin users must change passwords every 90 days.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes the React application, managing UI, state, API interactions, and rendering forms with complex conditional and cascading logic. Contains , , , , , and  components.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  ****: Fixed  by moving  out of fetch functions. Applied consistent UI styling (banners, card gradients, organized filters) across Dashboard, Pivot Analytics, Sub Agenzie, Agenti, Referenti tabs. Implemented conditional rendering of tabs and sidebar visibility based on user roles (, , , , , ). Modified  default based on user role.
        2.  ****: Integrated  to check user roles. Disabled the status  element if the user is not .
        3.  ****: Modified rendering of Edit/Delete buttons to be conditional based on client status (inserito, ko) and user role, allowing only  to modify/delete clients with these statuses.
        4.  ****: Uses  from the parent, which now incorporates service filtering.
        5.  **Global**: Enhanced sidebar logic to show Analytics button for the newly authorized roles.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines all FastAPI endpoints, handles data models, implements business logic, and interacts with MongoDB.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  **Models (, )**: Added  for password expiration.
        2.  **Model ()**: Default  changed from  to . Fixed status enum value to  (lowercase with underscore).
        3.  **Endpoints (, , , , , , )**: Modified to filter  and  by  and , ensuring roles only see data they are authorized for.
        4.  **Endpoint ()**:
            -   : Sets default status to .
            -   : Uses  to enforce status modification permissions (only  can change status).
            -   : Uses  to enforce deletion permissions.
        5.  **Permission Helpers**:
            -   : Updated logic to block modification for inserito or ko statuses for all roles except . Also,  can modify clients within their authorized commesse.
            -   : New function created to handle specific deletion logic, allowing authorized users to delete clients unless status is inserito or ko (only  can delete those).
            -   : New function created to bypass status-based modification blocks for document uploads, allowing all users to upload documents.
        6.  **Endpoint ()**: Modified to use  for permission checks.
        7.  **Endpoint ()**: Added logic to check  and set  if 90 days have passed (for non-admin users).
        8.  **Endpoint ()**: Updates  upon successful password change.
        9.  **Endpoint ()**:  sets  for new users.
        10. **Database**: Admin user was recreated due to an empty database on deployment.

<pending_tasks>
-   Populate the production database with necessary base data (commesse, servizi, filiere, etc.) through a seeding script, as the current deployment environment has an empty database.
-   Address potential issues with the  and  roles regarding data visibility if  is false.
-   Investigate and implement authorization checks for the  endpoint, as it currently lacks them.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical issue identified during application deployment: the production MongoDB instance is empty. This means essential data, such as  and  necessary for client creation and data filtering, is missing. This directly impacts the application's ability to function correctly in a deployed environment, preventing clients from being created and filters from working as expected. The immediate task is to develop and execute a seeding mechanism to populate the database with this foundational data. This task has been initiated with the proposal to create a seed script.
