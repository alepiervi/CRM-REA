The AI engineer's work trajectory involved a multi-faceted approach to stabilize and enhance the Nureal CRM application. Initially, the focus was on critical production issues: transitioning document uploads from a problematic Playwright-based Aruba Drive integration to a more robust Nextcloud WebDAV API. This included extensive debugging of CORS errors, URL misconfigurations, and 504 Gateway Timeouts. A significant bug was identified and fixed where  was incorrectly saved as unknown in the database despite successful Nextcloud uploads. The engineer also discovered and corrected a critical configuration oversight where Nextcloud was globally disabled for , causing uploads to default to local storage. Finally, the work pivoted to resolving deployment failures, addressing hardcoded frontend URLs, removing unused Playwright dependencies, making MongoDB environment variable access more resilient, enhancing the health check, and correctly configuring CORS for the deployment environment. The iterative debugging and problem-solving demonstrate a systematic approach to resolving complex issues across the full stack.

<product_requirements>
The Nureal CRM manages clients and projects, featuring a multi-step client form, role-based access, Excel export, and detailed modification views. Key functionalities include displaying Convergenza SIM, Dati Mobile, and Telepass data, alongside dynamic client list filters and an Analytics section with Pivot Analytics and Sub Agenzie analysis, all restricted by  and . Client creation defaults to Passata al BO, with status modification/deletion restricted to Backoffice Commessa for Inserito or Ko statuses. Document uploads are universally permitted regardless of client status. Non-admin users have 90-day password expiration. Recent enhancements addressed include fixing Aruba Drive uploads (pivoted to Nextcloud WebDAV), resolving production CORS, URL, and 504 Gateway Timeout errors, dynamic backend adaptation to  with specific cloud folders, simplified augmented filename uploads, ensuring production backend stability, fixing WebSocket URL errors, and resolving mobile UI issues (sidebar, scrolling). The system needs to auto-detect and select Nextcloud folders for  configuration and upload documents to the correct cloud folders, not local storage.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles the main React application, UI rendering, state management, and all interactions with the backend API.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored  to ensure it dynamically uses  instead of hardcoded values, which was causing deployment issues. This ensures correct backend communication in production environments.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the FastAPI application, defining all API endpoints, business logic, and interactions with MongoDB and external services like Nextcloud WebDAV.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Refined  logic: Ensured  is correctly set to nextcloud or local before saving to MongoDB, preventing unknown values. Removed initial  to force dynamic assignment.
        -   Removed  related imports and unused code, as the application now exclusively uses Nextcloud WebDAV.
        -   Modified environment variable access for  and  to use  with default values, preventing  during startup in environments where variables might not be immediately available.
        -   Enhanced the  endpoint to include a check for MongoDB connection, providing more robust health status.
        -   Added  to  to allow communication from the deployed frontend.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Manages Python dependencies for the backend server.
    -   **Changes**:  and  were previously removed during the transition to WebDAV, which was verified.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for the frontend, crucially .
    -   **Changes**: 's usage was corrected in  to ensure dynamic resolution.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for the backend, like , , and .
    -   **Changes**:  was updated to include the production frontend URL ().
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Used for communication with testing agents and tracking test outcomes.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated with task statuses, agent communications, and test results, documenting the journey of fixing upload and deployment issues.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on diagnosing and resolving critical deployment failures, specifically a 520 status code and backend startup issues, when attempting to deploy the application to a production Kubernetes environment. The troubleshooting process involved:

1.  **Addressing Frontend Hardcoded URLs**: Identified and removed hardcoded backend URLs in , ensuring  is used for dynamic resolution ().
2.  **Cleaning Up Playwright**: Confirmed that  and its dependencies were no longer needed (due to the pivot to WebDAV) and removed lingering imports from  (). It was also verified that  was already clean of these dependencies ().
3.  **Robust MongoDB Connection**: Modified  to use  with default values for  and  to prevent  at startup in production environments ().
4.  **Enhanced Health Check**: Updated the  endpoint in  to include a check for the MongoDB connection, providing a more comprehensive liveness check for the deployed application ().
5.  **CORS Configuration**: Added  to the  list in  to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend from its deployed domain ().

After these code modifications, the backend was restarted (), and it started successfully, indicating that the immediate startup issues might be resolved. The engineer was preparing to summarize the fixes ().

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to initiate a new deployment to verify the fixes for the production deployment errors.
