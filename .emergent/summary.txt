The AI engineer's work traversed multiple critical phases: initial mobile-friendliness fixes, document management implementation, and extensive system enhancements. Initially, the focus was on resolving JSX errors, responsive UI for tables and sidebar, and distinct mobile/desktop analytics views. A significant part involved fixing a  error and a 400 backend error due to a duplicate  endpoint. Subsequently, new features were added: multi-file upload with progress bars, client detail screenshots, and preparation for Aruba Drive integration. The application was rebranded to ELON - System All in One, including login and dashboard screens. An automatic 15-minute inactivity logout system was implemented. The latest work centered on implementing hierarchical Commesse → Servizi → Tipologie Contratto management, including CRUD operations, and integrating existing hardcoded contract types. The current challenge involves displaying correctly associated contract types, especially for the 'Fotovoltaico' commessa, and handling newly created types.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix Filtering Bug for Fotovoltaico**: Address the issue where the 'Fotovoltaico' commessa displays incorrect contract types (Fastweb types) in the sidebar selectors.
-   **Display Created Tipologie**: Ensure newly created contract types are visible in the Commesse → Servizi → Tipologie di Contratto hierarchy.
-   **Resolve JSON Parse Error**: Investigate and fix JSON parsing errors in backend endpoints related to specific services.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues with the Commesse section:
1.  **Tipologie create non visibili**: Newly created contract types were not appearing.
2.  **Fotovoltaico mostra tipologie sbagliate**: When selecting the 'Fotovoltaico' commessa and its services, incorrect contract types (specifically, Fastweb-related ones) were being displayed instead of the appropriate ones. This issue extends to the sidebar selectors.

The AI engineer has identified the root causes through testing:
*   The 'CER40' service under 'Fotovoltaico' does not match any condition in the hardcoded filtering logic.
*   There are JSON parsing errors in the backend endpoint responsible for fetching service-specific contract types.
*   A general filtering bug causes 'Fotovoltaico' to receive Fastweb tipologie.

The current task is to implement solutions for these problems, starting with fixing the filtering logic for 'Fotovoltaico' and then addressing the JSON parsing and visibility of created tipologie. The agent has received a procedi command from the user to continue.
