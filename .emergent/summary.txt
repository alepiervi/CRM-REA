The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of debugging and implementing complex features, primarily focused on refining role-based access control and hierarchical data filtering in the frontend, coupled with backend authorization fixes. Initially, the engineer resolved Pydantic validation errors and implemented a specialized Responsabile Commessa dashboard. A significant portion of the trajectory addressed a persistent issue with the Tipologia Contratto selector, which evolved from being entirely hidden due to incorrect rendering conditions, to displaying unfiltered data due to React state and function name collisions, and finally to authorization failures for non-admin users. The  proved crucial in diagnosing subtle React state timing issues and identifying repeated backend authorization flaws. The latest task involved implementing mobile-friendliness, which quickly revealed several UI/UX problems that are currently being addressed.

The application is a comprehensive CRM for lead distribution, administration, and analytics, supporting various roles (Admin, Referente, Agente, Responsabile Commessa, BackOffice Commessa, Responsabile Sub Agenzia, BackOffice Sub Agenzia, Agente Specializzato, Operatore). It includes dashboards, Excel export, mobile-friendliness, email notifications, an OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chatbot, Aruba Drive integration, and advanced lead qualification.

Previous work established user management with granular permissions (multiple commesse/sub agenzie/services) and analytical viewing flags. Recent focus included:
- Resolving login/user visibility issues.
- Implementing a Responsabile Commessa Dashboard with client summaries, sub-agencies, client CRUD, document management, and basic analytics.
- Refining the dashboard by removing redundant sections and adding a filtered Tipologia Contratto selector.
- Fixing  bugs related to  and  visibility.
- Ensuring correct loading and hierarchical filtering for , , , and  selectors.
- **Specific requirements addressed in this trajectory**: Tipologia Contratto must show only authorized types for the selected service. Hierarchical selectors (Commesse → Servizi → Tipologia Contratto → Sub Agenzie/Unit) must work for all account levels. Clients must be visible to users based on their roles and associated authorizations. The entire system must be mobile-friendly and functional across all sections.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Central for API endpoints, database models, and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Authorization Fixes**: Modified  and direct inline authorization checks in , , , and  to implement a dual check pattern. This ensures that user authorizations are correctly verified against  (direct field) in addition to (or instead of) checking a separate  collection, resolving numerous 403 Forbidden errors for non-admin users across various endpoints.
        -   **Endpoint Logic**: For , modified to handle  by returning services from *all* authorized commesse, rather than failing due to literal string matching.
        -   **Client Management**: Adjusted authorization logic in  and  for role-based visibility.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing routing, state, and UI.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Hierarchical Selectors & Filtering**:
            -   Refactored the order of sidebar selectors to: Commesse → Servizi → Tipologia Contratto → Sub Agenzie/Unit.
            -   Modified rendering conditions for selectors to appear in the new hierarchical order.
            -   Implemented  to trigger  when  and  change.
            -   Addressed React timing issues by adding direct calls to  within  and .
            -   Removed an initial  call on login that was fetching all types unfiltered.
        -   **State/Function Naming Conflicts**:
            -   Renamed multiple  state variables (e.g., , , ) and their corresponding setter functions to resolve state collision issues.
            -   Renamed multiple  functions (e.g., , ) to resolve function collision issues where the wrong function was being invoked by .
        -   **UI & Data Handling**:
            -   Resolved ESLint errors related to  and  by ensuring proper import and usage.
            -   **Client Creation ()**:
                -   Adjusted  to set  and  to  (or a valid default) instead of empty strings  when none is selected, preventing 422 validation errors.
                -   Temporarily removed some frontend form validations to debug submission issues.
                -   Fixed a syntax error () in the  function.
        -   **Mobile-Friendly UI**:
            -   Added  for  and  for responsive navigation.
            -   Modified the main Dashboard JSX layout to include a mobile sidebar with a hamburger menu button.
            -   Added missing selectors (Servizio, Tipologia Contratto) to the mobile sidebar.
            -   Implemented initial responsive CSS for the main layout.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Styles for the frontend application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added responsive styling for mobile layouts, including a mobile menu and sidebar visibility.

- Fix remaining mobile-friendliness issues:
  - Ensure tables are mobile-responsive using appropriate CSS.
  - Make the Logout button visible and functional on mobile.
  - Verify that all necessary sections are visible on mobile devices.
- Re-enable and refine frontend form validations in  (temporarily removed for debugging).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of mobile-friendliness issues reported by the user after the initial mobile UI implementation. The user specifically stated that Mancano delle sezioni inoltre non funzionano i selettori. La lista dei clienti o dei Lead sì vede scorrendo e non va bene. Inoltre manca tasto Logout (Sections are missing, selectors don't work. Client/Lead list scrolls, which is bad. Also, Logout button is missing).

The  was invoked and identified four critical issues: missing Servizio and Tipologia Contratto selectors on mobile, non-responsive tables, a hidden Logout button, and potentially missing sections.

The very last action taken was to add the missing Servizio and Tipologia Contratto selectors to the mobile sidebar in , completing the first of the four identified mobile-friendliness issues.

The next immediate sub-task identified by the  is to fix the mobile-friendly tables.
