The AI engineer systematically tackled multiple application issues in the Nureal CRM, progressing from initial deployment fixes to complex feature enhancements. Initially, the focus was on resolving Kubernetes deployment failures, including hardcoded URLs, improper environment variable usage, and CORS issues. This was followed by rectifying document download/view functionalities that failed for Nextcloud-stored files, leading to the creation of robust backend endpoints. A significant effort was dedicated to making backend enums dynamic to support user-created data for client creation, services, and contract types, resolving critical 422 validation errors. The cascading form logic was refined to accurately filter services and contract types based on selected sub-agency and commission. Subsequently, a comprehensive sub-offer system was introduced, involving extensive modifications to backend models and frontend forms for creation, display, and filtering. Recent work involved debugging a persistent CORS and 500 error in production, tracing it to a database name mismatch and a timezone-related  in the login endpoint. Finally, universal document upload was enabled, and the visibility of service names in client view/edit screens was fixed by adding a dedicated backend endpoint. The immediate task involves implementing a client assignment feature, with the backend endpoint already created.

The Nureal CRM manages clients and projects, featuring multi-step client forms, role-based access, and data exports. It displays Convergenza SIM, Dati Mobile, and Telepass data, alongside dynamic client list filters and an Analytics section, all restricted by  and . Client creation defaults to Passata al BO, with status modification/deletion restricted to Backoffice Commessa. Document uploads are universally permitted for all authenticated users. Non-admin users have 90-day password expiration.

The application has undergone several fixes and enhancements: problematic Aruba Drive uploads were pivoted to Nextcloud WebDAV; production CORS, URL, and 504 Gateway Timeout errors were resolved. The system now dynamically adapts the backend to  with specific cloud folders, simplifies augmented filename uploads, ensures backend stability, and resolves WebSocket URL and mobile UI issues. Critical production deployment issues causing 520 errors and backend startup failures have been addressed. The system needs to auto-detect and select Nextcloud folders based on  configurations, uploading documents to the correct cloud folders. Recent work includes allowing dynamic values for services and contract types in cascading forms, implementing soft deletion for inactive items, refining cascading filters to consider both sub-agency and commission, and developing a comprehensive sub-offer system for client creation, view, and edit. The current focus is on allowing users to assign clients to other users.

<pending_tasks>
- Initiate and monitor a new deployment to the production-like Kubernetes environment to verify that all fixes have successfully resolved the 520 errors and backend startup issues, as well as the recent 500 login error and CORS issues.
- Implement the UI in the frontend  to allow selection of a user for client assignment using the newly created backend endpoint.
- Verify the visibility of the assigned user in the client view/edit screens.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately focused on implementing the ability to associate a client with a user different from the creator. This involved first verifying the existence of an  field in the  model, which was confirmed to be present. The engineer then created a dedicated backend endpoint:

**:**

This endpoint handles authorization based on the current user's role and associated commissions/sub-agencies, ensuring only authorized users can assign clients. It also validates the existence of the target user. The next immediate step is to implement the frontend UI for this feature.

<optional_next_step>
Add a dropdown in the  component to select an existing user for assigning the client.
