The trajectory outlines the transition of development from an AI engineer to a human engineer. The previous AI engineer systematically expanded the CRM application. Initial work involved a major refactoring of the UI to a left-sidebar navigation and resolving a backend  dependency. Key features implemented include a GoHighLevel-style Workflow Builder with unit-specific configurations and a copy functionality, and unit-specific WhatsApp configurations with dynamic QR code generation. The current work detailed in the trajectory focused on implementing a comprehensive Call Center system with Twilio integration. Subsequent development included a robust Hierarchical Authorization System, client import functionality (CSV/XLS/XLSX), and extending the document management to include client-specific documents with hierarchical access. A temporary removal of the AI Configuration section occurred due to a misunderstanding, which is currently being rectified. The system uses React, FastAPI, and MongoDB.

The application is a comprehensive CRM system designed for lead distribution, administrative controls, and analytics, supporting Admin, Referente, and Agente roles. Leads from Facebook are distributed a goccia, with agents updating ESITO and Note. Admins have full CRUD for Users, Units, and Containers, plus activation/deactivation. Reporting includes dashboards and Excel export.

Recent enhancements include mobile-friendliness, email notifications, an OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chatbot per Unit, and Aruba Drive integration for document storage. An advanced lead qualification system involves bot interaction before agent assignment.

Within this trajectory, a left-sidebar navigation was implemented. A functional Workflow Builder (FASE 3) with drag-and-drop, custom nodes, and unit-specific workflows with copy functionality was added. WhatsApp configuration became unit-specific with QR code generation. A Call Center system with Twilio integration was implemented, featuring outbound calls, automatic distribution, scheduling, client pop-ups, call recording, and analytics. A hierarchical authorization system for commesse (projects/commissions) was implemented, defining roles (Responsabile Commessa, BackOffice Commessa, Agente Commessa, BackOffice Agenzia, Operatore) and granular access to client data, separate from leads. Client import from CSV/XLS/XLSX files was added. The document management system was extended to allow Sub Agencies to upload and manage documents specifically for their clients, not other leads or clients.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Central for API endpoints, database models, and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Call Center**: Added Pydantic models (e.g., , , ), services, Twilio imports/config (temporarily  import commented out), and API endpoints ().  and  imported from FastAPI.
        -   **Hierarchical Authorization**:  enum extended with new roles (e.g., ). New models (, , , , ), helper functions for permissions, and CRUD API endpoints. Default commesse initialized at startup.
        -   **Client Import**: Added models (, ), parsing helpers for CSV/Excel, and API endpoints ().
        -   **Documents**:  and  models modified to accept  or . Document API endpoints (, , ) were refactored for type-specific filtering and hierarchical access control.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing routing, state, and UI.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Call Center**: Added icons (e.g., ), Call Center navigation item,  component, and  case.
        -   **Login Fixes**: Removed hardcoded default credentials, enhanced  function, added  interceptor for token refresh,  function.
        -   **Hierarchical Authorization**: Added icons (e.g., , ), navigation items for Commesse, Sub Agenzie, Clienti, and corresponding , ,  components, and  cases.
        -   **Client Import**: Added  icon and  component.
        -   **Documents**: Refactored  component with Documenti Lead and Documenti Clienti tabs, dynamic filtering, and a redesigned  to handle both lead and client document uploads.
        -   **Chat AI/Assistant Management**:  component and its navigation/ entry were removed.  and its related logic (for OpenAI API key and assistant setup) was initially removed by mistake and is currently being restored.
        -   Resolved multiple duplicate icon imports (e.g., , , ).
-   
    -   **Importance**: Python package dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: ,  added. Ensured  and  handled (though  import was commented out as a temporary fix).
-   
    -   **Importance**: Node.js package dependencies for the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**:  (implicitly, as it was already mentioned in previous work summary as an addition).
-   
    -   **Importance**: Environment variables for backend configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**: , ,  added.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Reports & Excel Export (Frontend)**: Development of the frontend UI for advanced reports with graphs, custom filters, and initiating Excel download.
-   **WhatsApp System (Full Implementation)**: Beyond configuration, real-time message handling, and automated lead validation beyond simulation are pending.
-   **Automated Lead Qualification (FASE 4)**: Implementation of automated lead engagement, 12-hour timeout for bot response, and auto-assignment to agents.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with removing the Chat AI/Assistant section from the frontend. This was implemented by removing the navigation entry,  case, and the  and  components, along with related state and functions. However, the user clarified that the *AI Configuration* section (responsible for OpenAI API key setup and assistant management for lead generation) should *not* have been removed, only the *Chat AI* interactive chat component.

Therefore, the AI engineer's precise current work involves rectifying this misunderstanding. The last actions in the trajectory show the AI engineer in the process of restoring the  navigation item, its corresponding  case, and the  component, along with relevant state () and data fetching functions () in . This is a critical step to ensure that the lead generation capabilities leveraging OpenAI are re-enabled and properly configured, without reintroducing the interactive chat UI.
