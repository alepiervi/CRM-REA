The trajectory details an extensive development cycle, predominantly focusing on an Italian CRM application. Initially, the AI solidified client filter options and  functionality. A significant portion involved refining role-based authorization across multiple user types, ensuring data integrity, and correcting UI elements for proper visibility. Key updates included addressing cascading selector issues, refining Excel exports, and resolving  and  errors related to user permissions and data access. The AI meticulously debugged frontend-backend discrepancies, often using automated testing and . Recent work involved a major refactor of user creation/edit modals to handle dynamic multi-select commessa and service fields, and the removal of duplicate UI elements for various roles. The application was renamed to Nureal, new client filters were added, and mobile responsiveness was a critical focus. The latest task involves integrating a new Area Manager role, which is currently underway.

<product_requirements>
The application is an internal CRM for managing clients and Commesse (projects).
1.  **Client Management**: Users must create, view, and manage clients via dynamic search filters (Sub Agenzia, Tipologia Contratto, Status, Utente Creatore, Servizi, Segmento, Commesse). Filters must display all system-wide options and data associated with user authorization. A multi-step cascading selection (filiera) for new client creation (Sub Agenzia -> Commessa -> Servizio -> Tipologia Contratto -> Segmento -> Offerta) must dynamically populate based on user roles and authorized data. Excel export should be  with full filiera data.
2.  **User Role & Authorization**: Granular role-based access control is critical for roles like Admin, Responsabile Commessa, BackOffice Commessa, Responsabile Sub Agenzia, BackOffice Sub Agenzia, Agente Specializzato, Operatore, Responsabile Store, Responsabile Presidi, Store Assist, Promoter Presidi, and now **Area Manager**. Each role requires distinct permissions for viewing, creating, and filtering client data, with strict data privacy (e.g., only seeing own authorized data). All user creation/modification forms must be functional, with dynamic fields for multi-selection of commesse and associated services.
3.  **UI/UX & Session Stability**: Ensures reliable navigation, stable user sessions, and correct UI visibility. All sections must be fully responsive for mobile, and the desktop sidebar must remain compact, with fixed height, not expanding with content. The app name should be Nureal System All in One.
4.  **Document Management**: Upload client documents to Aruba Drive, manage credentials, create hierarchical folder structures, and provide inline viewing (initial requirement, not directly modified in trajectory).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the new  user role. This involves updating both the backend and frontend.

On the backend, the  role has been added to the  enum and integrated into the  and  endpoints to ensure proper authorization for viewing and filtering clients based on authorized sub agenzie.

On the frontend, the  role has been added to the role selection options in both  and . It has also been integrated into the navigation logic for the Clienti section and the cascading logic for client creation.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI was implementing the conditional fields for the  role within the  and  (around line 4260 in  for CreateUserModal and similar in EditUserModal). This section is designed to allow the  to select multiple sub agenzie, which is crucial for fulfilling the requirement that they can see and create clients for their assigned sub agenzie. The last action (Chat Message 690) was modifying the  to include this dedicated section for .
