The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the core application features (rebranding, security, document management) and then focused heavily on iterating the hierarchical management system. The primary challenges revolved around state management inconsistencies in , handling the co-existence of hardcoded business logic (Fastweb types) alongside database-driven models, and implementing full data deletion capabilities. Key accomplishments include resolving 'Fotovoltaico' filtering bugs, expanding the hierarchy to five levels (Commesse -> ... -> Segmento -> Offerta) with full CRUD backend implementation, adding universal search to Clienti Management, and integrating Admin tools for migrating/disabling hardcoded elements. The current work halted mid-feature implementation after the user requested advanced configuration options for the  model, involving webhooks, internal descriptions, and feature flags (AI, Whatsapp, Call Center). The codebase is stable from a compilation perspective, but the new Commessa configuration feature is incomplete.

<product_requirements>
The application, branded as ELON - System All in One, is a CRM supporting lead distribution, administration, and analytics.

**Implemented Feature Requirements:**
1.  **Hierarchical Management:** Extended structure: Commessa → Servizio → Tipologia Contratto → Segmento → Nome Offerta. Segmenti (Privato, Business) must be auto-created and toggleable.
2.  **Hardcoded Element Migration:** Ability for Admins to migrate hardcoded Commesse, Servizi, and Tipologie (primarily Fastweb/Fotovoltaico) to the database for full cancellability, and to globally disable hardcoded elements from being displayed.
3.  **Full CRUD/Deletion:** Admin must be able to delete all entities (Commesse, Servizi, Tipologie, Clienti, Lead), including associated documents, while maintaining data integrity (deletion is blocked if dependencies exist).
4.  **Clienti Search:** Universal search in Clienti/Lead sections filtering by ID, Cognome, Codice Fiscale, P.IVA, Telefono (Cellulare included), and Email.
5.  **Role/Entity Management:**  and  models must specify whether they manage  or .

**Pending Requirements (Currently being implemented):**
1.  **Advanced Commessa Configuration:** Add fields to  for internal descriptions, Zapier  integration, and feature flags (, , ). Control document access based on .

-   **Stack:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Data Management:** Extensive use of UUIDs for MongoDB keys. Pydantic models for data validation.
-   **Frontend:** React hooks (, ), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Shadcn UI components.
-   **Architecture:** Backend API routes prefixed with . Global state managed in  (Dashboard component) and passed down to children (e.g., ).

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the frontend UI changes for the advanced  configuration (internal descriptions, webhook, feature flags for AI/Whatsapp/Call Center) in the .
-   Update user management UI to include the  field.
-   Ensure all deletion flows and dependency protections work as expected (Servizi/Commesse deletion remains a user testing concern).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that hardcoded Fastweb services/commesse were not deletable. The engineer confirmed this was due to data integrity protection (services had associated Tipologie) and hardcoded elements were still visible when they shouldn't be (a caching/display logic bug).

The user then provided a new, large feature request: enhancing the  model with advanced configuration options, regardless of the pending deletion issue status.

The current work started to implement this new request:
1.  Defined new fields for the  model in  to support , , , , , and  (Chat Message 655).
2.  The engineer's immediate next step (Chat Message 656) was to update the frontend form () to support these new fields.

The application is stable and compiling, but the new  feature is only partially implemented (backend model updated, frontend update pending).
