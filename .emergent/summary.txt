The AI engineer systematically addressed critical deployment failures identified by a 520 status code in a Kubernetes environment. Initial diagnostics revealed hardcoded frontend URLs, improper environment variable access, and insufficient CORS configuration. The engineer corrected  to dynamically use  and updated  to include the deployed frontend's URL in . Furthermore,  was refined to ensure robust MongoDB connection handling at startup by wrapping initial DB operations in a  block, preventing blocking issues. Playwright dependencies were confirmed removed, and the health check was enhanced. After local verification, a deployment readiness scan reported the application PRONTO PER LA PRODUZIONE, signifying successful resolution of the identified deployment impediments.

The Nureal CRM is a comprehensive application for managing clients and projects, featuring multi-step client forms, role-based access, and data exports. It displays Convergenza SIM, Dati Mobile, and Telepass data, alongside dynamic client list filters and an Analytics section with Pivot Analytics and Sub Agenzie analysis, all restricted by  and . Client creation defaults to Passata al BO, with status modification/deletion restricted to Backoffice Commessa. Document uploads are universally permitted. Non-admin users have 90-day password expiration.

Recent work fixed problematic Aruba Drive uploads by pivoting to Nextcloud WebDAV, resolved production CORS, URL, and 504 Gateway Timeout errors. The system now dynamically adapts the backend to  with specific cloud folders, simplifies augmented filename uploads, ensures backend stability, and resolves WebSocket URL errors and mobile UI issues. The core problem at hand was ensuring the application correctly auto-detects and selects Nextcloud folders based on  configurations, uploading documents to the correct cloud folders instead of local storage, and most recently, resolving critical production deployment issues causing 520 errors and backend startup failures.

The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving critical deployment failures, specifically a 520 status code and backend startup issues in a Kubernetes environment. The troubleshooting involved:
1.  **Frontend URL Fix**: Corrected  to use  for dynamic backend URL resolution.
2.  **Playwright Cleanup**: Confirmed removal of  and its dependencies from  and .
3.  **Robust MongoDB Access**: Modified  to use  with default values for  and  to prevent .
4.  **Enhanced Health Check**: Updated  in  to include a MongoDB connection check.
5.  **CORS Configuration**: Added the deployed frontend's URL () to  in .
6.  **Resilient Startup**: Wrapped MongoDB operations within  in a  block in  to prevent startup blocking due to MongoDB availability issues.

After these changes, the backend restarted successfully locally, and a screenshot confirmed the frontend was loading correctly and using the correct environment variables, with a minor WebSocket error noted as non-blocking. A deployment readiness scan was conducted and reported PRONTO PER LA PRODUZIONE (Ready for Production), indicating the fixes are likely successful.
