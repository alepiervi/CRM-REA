The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles an intricate, iterative process focused on enhancing an existing CRM application's mobile-friendliness and implementing a robust document management system with granular role-based access. Initially, significant effort was dedicated to fixing pervasive JSX compilation errors, rectifying mobile UI components like responsive tables and sidebar navigation, and ensuring all hierarchical selectors were correctly displayed and functional. A key challenge involved resolving duplicate code and ensuring a clean, dedicated mobile experience for various sections, particularly Analytics. The recent focus shifted to integrating a document management feature, which exposed backend authorization complexities and frontend rendering issues, including a critical  error. The engineer is currently in the process of resolving duplicate backend API endpoints to address a 400 error.

The application is a comprehensive CRM designed for lead distribution, administration, and analytics, supporting diverse user roles (Admin, Referente, Agente, Responsabile Commessa, BackOffice Commessa, Responsabile Sub Agenzia, BackOffice Sub Agenzia, Agente Specializzato, Operatore). It features dashboards, Excel export, email notifications, an OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chatbot, Aruba Drive integration, and advanced lead qualification.

**Previous work** focused on granular user permissions, resolving login/user visibility, implementing a Responsabile Commessa Dashboard (client summaries, sub-agencies, client CRUD, document management, analytics), and refining dashboard selectors (Tipologia Contratto).

**Specific requirements addressed in this trajectory**:
1.  **Tipologia Contratto selector**: Must show only authorized types for the selected service.
2.  **Hierarchical Selectors**: Commesse → Servizi → Tipologia Contratto → Sub Agenzie/Unit must function for all account levels.
3.  **Client Visibility**: Must be restricted based on user roles and associated authorizations.
4.  **Mobile-friendliness (initial)**: The entire system must be mobile-friendly and functional across all sections, including responsive tables, visible Logout button, and all necessary sections.
5.  **Mobile UI refinement**: Clienti and Lead lists must show name, surname, and action buttons on mobile, not just IDs. Analytics section requires distinct mobile and desktop views, with perfectly visible and touch-friendly internal navigation tabs, and removal of any duplicated/refused elements on mobile.
6.  **Document Management**: A new section enabling all users to upload/download documents associated with clients/leads based on their commessa authorizations. Admin can see all documents; Responsabile Commessa/BackOffice Commessa can access documents for their authorized commesse/sub-agenzie; Responsabile Sub Agenzie/Backoffice Agenzia for their agency's authorized commesse; Agente Specializzato/Operatore for documents of anagrafiche they created. This system needs robust backend authorization and frontend rendering.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design, Shadcn UI components.
-   **Authorization**: Role-based access control with granular permissions (, , ) and dual check pattern in the backend.
-   **React State Management**: ,  for data fetching, handling component lifecycle.
-   **API Communication**:  for HTTP requests,  for backend data validation.
-   **File Handling**: Document upload/download capabilities.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture, utilizing React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.



-   
    -   **Importance**: Handles API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic, including authorization.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Document Management Endpoints**: Added  GET endpoint for fetching documents with role-based filtering, and  POST endpoint for uploading documents.
        -   **Authorization Logic**: Modified existing authorization logic to enforce role-based access for document visibility and actions.
        -   **Error**: Currently contains a duplicate  endpoint (at line 3748 and 7871), causing a 400 error due to validation conflicts during document fetching, and requiring removal of the old endpoint.

-   
    -   **Importance**: The main React component, managing routing, global state, and the application's UI structure. Most frontend logic and UI rendering for various sections reside here.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Mobile-friendliness (General)**:
            -   Extensively modified mobile sidebar ( state) to ensure all hierarchical selectors (Commesse, Servizi, Tipologia Contratto, Unit/Sub Agenzia) are present and functional, with correct cascading behavior.
            -   Implemented responsive card layouts for  and  tables on mobile, displaying detailed information (name, surname, actions) instead of just IDs.
            -   Refined the  section to have separate, dedicated mobile (vertical card-based) and desktop (grid-based) views, with clear navigation tabs, enhanced contrast, and removal of duplicate/refused header elements and date filters on mobile.
            -   Corrected numerous JSX syntax errors, unclosed  tags, and adjacent JSX elements during UI modifications.
            -   Ensured the Logout button is visible and functional within the mobile sidebar.
        -   **Documents Management**:
            -   Integrated  component: added to  and  for appropriate role access.
            -   Extensive debugging and refactoring to completely replace old, malformed  code with a new, role-aware implementation. This involved removing large blocks of outdated code and fixing return outside of function and similar JSX compilation errors.
            -   Imported necessary Lucide React icons (, , ).

-   
    -   **Importance**: Provides global and component-specific styling for the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Added responsive CSS for mobile layouts, including mobile menu, sidebar visibility, and tables (, ) to manage horizontal scroll.
        -   Adjusted padding and heights for mobile UI elements to optimize space and visibility.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend  Fix**: Resolve the  error, indicating the  state is not an array.
-   **Backend  Endpoint Fix**: Remove the duplicate  GET endpoint in  to resolve the 400 error and  validation issues.
-   **Frontend Form Validations**: Re-enable and refine frontend form validations in  (temporarily removed for debugging).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues reported by the user regarding the newly implemented Documenti section:
1.  **Backend Error 400**: An  message, indicating a server-side problem.
2.  **Frontend Runtime Error**:  in the  component, preventing the documents section from rendering correctly on all user levels. The user explicitly stated, Errore quando entro nella sezione Documenti su tutti i livelli... risolvi urgentemente e definitivamente. Deve funzionare tutto al 100%.

The engineer diagnosed the backend 400 error as stemming from a **duplicate  GET endpoint** in . One endpoint exists at line 3748, which is old and problematic, and a new, correct one at line 7871. The current task involves removing the older, problematic endpoint to resolve the validation conflicts and the 400 error it causes. The engineer is in the process of identifying the exact extent of the old endpoint to remove it cleanly.
