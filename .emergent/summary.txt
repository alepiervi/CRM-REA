The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has been a series of iterative fixes and feature implementations, primarily driven by user feedback. Initial efforts focused on frontend bug resolution and UI/UX improvements, followed by a major overhaul of role-based access control affecting both frontend rendering and backend data filtering. Granular permissions for client management and a 90-day password expiration policy were also introduced.

The most recent and extensive work has revolved around two critical production issues: an empty database post-deployment (resolved by a targeted admin-only seeding script) and the highly problematic Aruba Drive document upload. The Aruba Drive issue has been a persistent challenge, necessitating multiple diagnostic and solution attempts. This involved debugging Playwright installation failures in production, addressing CORS errors, optimizing timeouts, and finally pivoting to a WebDAV-based solution, which also faced URL and path sanitization issues. The latest attempt involved re-implementing Playwright with an automatic lazy installation approach to resolve persistent upload failures.

The Nureal CRM is designed for comprehensive client and project management, featuring a multi-step client creation form with conditional fields and robust role-based access controls. Users need to export client data to Excel, detailing SIM information. Client modification must reflect creation with read-only organizational data and display activated offers, Note Back Office, full credit card numbers, and updated statuses, with dynamic Offerte linked to filiera.

Recently, the application was enhanced to:
- Display Convergenza SIM data and include Dati Mobile and Telepass sections, exclusive of Telefonia Fastweb.
- Redefine client list columns and introduce dynamic advanced filters.
- Implement a new Analytics section with Pivot Analytics and Sub Agenzie comparative analysis, with a streamlined UI.
- Grant access to Analytics and client/sub-agenzia data to specific roles (Responsabile Commessa, Backoffice Commessa, etc.), with data filtered by authorized  and .
- Set the default client creation status to Passata al BO. Only Backoffice Commessa can modify client statuses, and modification/deletion is blocked for Inserito or Ko statuses, except for Backoffice Commessa.
- Allow all users to upload documents irrespective of client status.
- Enforce a 90-day password expiration for non-admin users.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing the persistent issue of Aruba Drive document uploads failing in the production environment, despite working in preview. The latest attempt involved re-implementing the document upload functionality to leverage Playwright's native lazy installation capability. This approach aims to automatically download the necessary browser components (e.g., Chromium) during the first upload attempt in production, without requiring manual SSH access or problematic startup scripts that caused deployment timeouts. The code changes for this Lazy Installation Automatica within  have just been completed, and the backend has been restarted to apply these modifications. The user's last feedback indicates the upload is still fast and falls back to local storage, suggesting the lazy installation might not yet be successful or the problem persists.

<optional_next_step>
Test the Aruba Drive document upload functionality in the preview environment to confirm if the Playwright lazy installation now works as intended.
