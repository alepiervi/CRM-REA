The AI engineer systematically developed and enhanced a comprehensive CRM application, following a phased approach based on user requests. Initially, core features like JWT authentication, multi-role user management, and basic CRUD operations were established. The trajectory details the implementation of several key functionalities: Aruba Drive integration for document management, an OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chatbot with a WhatsApp-like interface, and robust lead management with Excel export capabilities.

The AI successfully implemented CRUD for Units and Leads, enhanced document search with name/surname filters, and resolved several critical frontend and backend bugs, including  errors and ChatBot session creation issues. A significant portion of the work involved planning and initiating an advanced lead qualification system using AI and WhatsApp. The current task involves refactoring the frontend navigation to a left sidebar, which is ongoing, with the AI actively removing deprecated UI components. This iterative development showcases a strong problem-solving capability and adherence to evolving product requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a comprehensive CRM system with robust lead distribution, administrative controls, and analytical dashboards. The system supports three roles: Admin, Referente, and Agente. Leads from Facebook campaigns are distributed a goccia to agents based on client Provincia, with agents specifying their coverage. Lead data includes standard fields, IP, ID, Campaign, Privacy, Marketing, and custom fields. Agents update ESITO (outcome) and Note. Admin features include full CRUD for Users, Units (with unique webhook URLs and personalized dashboards), and Containers, plus user activation/deactivation. Reporting includes dashboards with analytics and Excel export.

Recent enhancements include mobile-friendliness, email notifications for lead assignment, OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chatbot integration per Unit for internal WhatsApp-like communication with client profile updates, and Aruba Drive integration for client document storage. The goal is an advanced lead qualification system where leads chat with a bot before agent assignment, visible in the app, and auto-assigned if no bot response within 12 hours, using a WhatsApp-like interface.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a significant frontend refactoring task. The user explicitly requested to reorganize the application's interface to use a left-sided navigation sidebar instead of the previous top-bar navigation, with Unit selection as the primary item and only the logout button remaining at the top.

The AI engineer has begun implementing this change by modifying . Specifically, the AI successfully incorporated the new sidebar structure and is now in the process of removing the deprecated navigation components that were previously responsible for the top navigation and Unit selection. The last recorded action was identifying and removing the  component from . The  component is also slated for removal. This is a critical UI/UX refactoring that affects the entire application's layout and user interaction flow.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue refactoring the frontend navigation by removing the  component and ensuring the new left sidebar fully integrates all navigation items.
