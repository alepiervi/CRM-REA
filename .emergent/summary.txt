The trajectory details the AI engineer's iterative efforts to resolve critical production issues and implement feature enhancements. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing Aruba Drive document uploads, which involved attempts with Playwright's lazy installation, followed by extensive debugging of CORS errors, URL misconfigurations, and 504 Gateway Timeouts. This led to a major pivot from Playwright to Nextcloud WebDAV API for uploads, addressing performance and reliability. Concurrently, significant effort was invested in improving the mobile UI, specifically fixing sidebar visibility, section scrolling, and overall responsiveness. The latter part of the trajectory focused on refining the Nextcloud integration, particularly ensuring dynamic  folder auto-detection and resolving persistent 403 Forbidden errors due to incorrect WebDAV paths and missing headers, leaving the core upload logic under investigation.

The Nureal CRM is for client and project management, featuring a multi-step client form, role-based access, Excel export, and detailed client modification views. Recent enhancements include:
- Display of Convergenza SIM data, Dati Mobile, and Telepass sections (excluding Telefonia Fastweb).
- Redefined client list columns and dynamic advanced filters.
- A new Analytics section with Pivot Analytics and Sub Agenzie comparative analysis, with role-based access filtered by  and .
- Default client creation status Passata al BO; only Backoffice Commessa can modify statuses. Modification/deletion blocked for Inserito or Ko statuses, except for Backoffice Commessa.
- All users can upload documents irrespective of client status.
- 90-day password expiration for non-admin users.

Recent requests also include:
- Fixing Aruba Drive document uploads in production, ensuring necessary components (Playwright) install automatically (later pivoted to Nextcloud WebDAV).
- Resolving persistent CORS errors, incorrect backend URLs, and 504 Gateway Timeouts affecting production uploads.
- Ensuring the backend dynamically adapts to  created from the frontend, with commessa-specific cloud folders.
- Simplifying document upload by storing files directly in a root folder with an augmented filename (Order, Phone, Client Name).
- Ensuring the production backend () is always active and doesn't go into standby.
- Fixing WebSocket URL errors (port NaN).
- Resolving mobile UI issues: sidebar not visible/toggle not working, content not scrolling within sections.
- Implementing auto-detection and selection of Nextcloud cloud folders for  configuration, instead of manual input.
- Ensuring documents are uploaded to the correct Nextcloud cloud folders, not local storage.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main React application, UI, state, API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored for  fixes, standardized UI styling, conditional rendering based on roles. Implemented dynamic backend URL detection logic (then later hardcoded to address deployment issues). Fixed mobile sidebar visibility and content scrolling issues. Updated UI labels from Aruba Drive to Cloud for documents. Modified  to include Carica Cartelle button and a Select dropdown for  after fetching available folders from the backend.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI endpoints, data models, business logic, MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**:  for Playwright was made more robust. CORS middleware dynamically includes  and . Playwright-based upload was entirely replaced with  using WebDAV (). Simplified upload logic to use a single root folder and augment filenames. Added  endpoint for liveness checks. Implemented  endpoint to fetch available folders from Nextcloud WebDAV. Fixed WebDAV paths and added  header for  operations to resolve 403 errors.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes**:  and  (Playwright dependency) were removed when transitioning to WebDAV.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was modified multiple times, eventually hardcoded in  temporarily, then reverted to  in code, but the  value remained .  corrected from a concatenated string.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was explicitly set to include .
-   **Markdown files (e.g., , , , )**
    -   **Importance**: Document solutions and user instructions.
    -   **Changes**: New files were created to document various fixes, workarounds, and deployment instructions for the user regarding Playwright installation, CORS/504 errors, backend standby, Nextcloud integration, and environment variable configuration.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging an issue where, despite the  configuration being correctly set for Nextcloud WebDAV (e.g.,  with  and ), document uploads are still being saved to local storage instead of the configured cloud folder. The previous steps involved a major shift from Playwright-based Aruba Drive uploads to a more stable Nextcloud WebDAV API integration, including:
1.  **Backend ()**:
    *   Replacing Playwright logic with a  for WebDAV operations (upload, list folders).
    *   Implementing a  endpoint to fetch available folders.
    *   Correcting the WebDAV path to  and adding a  header for all requests to resolve 403 Forbidden errors when listing folders.
    *   Adjusting the upload logic to simplify folder creation and augment filenames with client details.
    *   Removing Playwright dependencies from .
2.  **Frontend ()**:
    *   Updating the UI to reflect Cloud storage instead of Aruba Drive.
    *   Modifying the  in the  section to include dynamic folder selection: users can now click a Carica Cartelle button to fetch and select an available Nextcloud folder via a dropdown, rather than manually typing the path.
The current state is that the backend's folder listing works, but the file upload is still falling back to local storage, suggesting a problem in how the  configuration is used within the upload endpoint to direct files to Nextcloud. The engineer is inspecting the  endpoint in  to identify where  and  might be incorrectly handled.
