The AI engineer systematically addressed several complex feature enhancements and critical bug fixes. Initially, a major frontend refactoring transitioned the application from a top-bar to a left-sided navigation sidebar, successfully integrating all existing modules and resolving a backend dependency issue (). Subsequently, Phase 3: Workflow Builder was implemented, featuring a GoHighLevel-style drag-and-drop canvas, custom nodes (e.g., Send WhatsApp, Set Status), and robust backend support for workflow management and validation. Critical user feedback led to fixing WhatsApp configuration issues, including phone number format validation and the generation of a dynamic QR code. A significant architectural change made both WhatsApp configurations and Workflow management unit-specific, adding a copy workflow functionality. The login functionality was also re-validated and confirmed working after the backend fixes. The current focus has shifted to designing and implementing a comprehensive Call Center system with Twilio integration.

The user requires a comprehensive CRM system with robust lead distribution, administrative controls, and analytical dashboards, supporting Admin, Referente, and Agente roles. Leads from Facebook campaigns are distributed a goccia to agents, with data including standard and custom fields. Agents update ESITO and Note. Admin features include full CRUD for Users, Units, and Containers, plus activation/deactivation. Reporting includes dashboards and Excel export.

Recent enhancements added mobile-friendliness, email notifications, an OpenAI GPT-4o Mini chatbot per Unit with a WhatsApp-like interface, and Aruba Drive integration for client document storage. An advanced lead qualification system is envisioned, where leads chat with a bot before agent assignment, with auto-assignment if no bot response within 12 hours.

The system now features a fully refactored left-sidebar navigation, a functional Workflow Builder (FASE 3) with GoHighLevel-style drag-and-drop, custom nodes, and unit-specific workflows with copy functionality. The WhatsApp configuration is now unit-specific, allowing dedicated numbers per unit, with a working QR code generation and resolved lag issues. The next major phase is implementing a Call Center system with automatic call distribution, recording, analytics, and dynamic outgoing numbers.

        -   Added  endpoint to duplicate workflows between units.
        -   Modified  model to include .
        -   Updated , ,  and  endpoints to filter and manage WhatsApp configurations based on .
        -   Fixed  related to  by ensuring correct  and  dependencies.
        -   Adjusted  endpoint to handle admin users without an assigned .

-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing global state, routing, UI rendering, and interaction with the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Refactored main navigation to a left sidebar layout, removing old navigation components (implicitly, as the structure was already updated before the current trajectory).
        -   Integrated  component for the drag-and-drop workflow canvas.
        -   Added Workflow Builder to  and .
        -   Implemented  component to display unit-specific workflows, including a Copy button and  for duplicating workflows to other units.
        -   Enhanced  component to be unit-aware, passing  to API calls and displaying the configured unit in the UI.
        -   Modified  to remove spaces from phone numbers before sending to the backend, resolving validation issues.
        -   Updated  to dynamically generate and display QR codes from base64 string data received from the backend using the  library.
        -   Removed aggressive  polling in  to resolve UI lag, optimizing API calls and loading states.
        -   Handled various UI interactions and state management for the new features.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Manages Python package dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Ensured  (and its underlying  system dependency) is correctly handled for document operations and general backend stability.

-   
    -   **Importance**: Manages Node.js package dependencies for the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  (for the workflow builder canvas) and  (for generating WhatsApp QR codes).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer initiated the implementation of a comprehensive Call Center system within the CRM. The user requested features including outbound calls from CSV/XLS lists or existing leads, automatic call distribution to the first available agent, scheduling three calls per lead at different times, pop-up client information during a call, appointment scheduling with automated call initiation, call recording, advanced analytics, and dynamic outgoing phone number generation every 30 minutes.

The AI engineer has acknowledged the ambitious nature of the request and, after consulting with the user regarding technology choices (WebRTC confirmed, no specific provider), has selected **Twilio** as the primary integration for testing and implementation due to its robust WebRTC and API capabilities. The last recorded action was receiving a detailed playbook for integrating **Twilio Voice with WebRTC** for the call center functionality from the  sub-agent. The current state is poised to begin the actual backend and frontend implementation guided by this playbook.
