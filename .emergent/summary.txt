<analysis>
The trajectory documents extensive full-stack development on an Italian CRM. Initially, the AI engineer fixed a sidebar navigation bug and evolved the Aruba Drive integration, addressing Playwright setup, file naming, and hierarchical folder structure issues. User feedback prompted fixes for backend enum compatibility, document view 403 errors (authentication headers, permissions), and critical session management bugs involving timer leaks, race conditions, JWT token refresh, and an interfering Axios interceptor, which ultimately led to a complete architectural redesign of the session logic. Finally, the focus shifted to client management: implementing Excel export, dynamic search filters, and resolving data consistency issues where filters incorrectly showed only data associated with existing clients rather than all available system data, culminating in a fix for hardcoded fictitious data in dynamic filter options. Multiple  calls were instrumental in diagnosing complex, persistent issues.

<product_requirements>
The application is an internal CRM for managing clients and projects (Commesse). Key implemented and refined requirements include:
1.  **Client Management**: Users can create, view, and manage clients. Critical fixes encompassed correct data mapping, backend enum validation, Excel download of client lists, and dynamic, data-driven custom search filters (Sub Agenzia, Tipologia Contratto, Status, Utente creatore) displaying all available system data.
2.  **Document Management with Aruba Drive**: The system uploads client documents to Aruba Drive. This involves configuring credentials at the Commessa level, automatic creation of a specific hierarchical folder structure (), and intelligent filenames (). A View button in the document list allows inline browser viewing without download, requiring robust authentication.
3.  **UI/UX & Session Stability**: Ensures reliable navigation and stable user sessions. The sidebar navigation bug was resolved. Critical session management issues (logout after inactivity, extend session not working) were identified as multi-faceted bugs leading to a complete architectural redesign and stabilization.

    -   **Importance**: This single file manages the entire React application's UI, state, and API interactions.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  **UI Navigation/Aruba Drive**: Fixed sidebar navigation bugs, refined Aruba Drive credential management UI. Corrected  to use the selected client's ID.
        2.  **Client Creation/Enum Mapping**: Resolved  and  issues for correct data handling.
        3.  **Document View**: Implemented  function using  and  to view documents inline, incorporating authentication and adding View buttons across desktop/mobile document lists.
        4.  **Session Management Redesign**: Replaced a complex multi-timer system with a simpler, robust single-timer architecture (, ). Updated , activity detection, and  to function with the new design, including JWT token refresh via . A problematic Axios interceptor was simplified to avoid premature logouts.
        5.  **Client Filters/Export UI**: Added new state variables and UI elements for dynamic custom filters (Sub Agenzia, Tipologia Contratto, Status, Utente Creatore). Updated the client export button to Esporta Excel and linked it to the new backend endpoint.
        6.  **Error Handling**: Fixed React Select  errors,  in , and  in  by correctly accessing the token from .

    -   **Importance**: This file contains the complete FastAPI backend, including API endpoints, database models, business logic, and the  class.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  **Aruba Drive Logic**: Refactored  for robust folder creation/navigation,  browser initialization, and corrected the Aruba Drive URL to .
        2.  **Document Upload**: Enhanced  to generate precise hierarchical paths and include client name, surname, and phone in filenames.
        3.  **Document View**: Added  endpoint to serve files inline, with comprehensive role-based authorization matching the download endpoint.
        4.  **API Fixes**: Resolved  error, optimized Playwright timeouts, and corrected response structures for  endpoints.
        5.  **Client Excel Export**: Implemented  to generate and serve client data in  format.
        6.  **Client Filters**: Updated  to support new filter parameters and apply them in MongoDB queries. Created  to dynamically fetch *all* unique filter options (Sub Agenzie, Tipologie Contratto, Status, Users) directly from primary database collections, ensuring consistency with client card displays (e.g., uppercase status values), and removing hardcoded fictitious data.
        7.  **Enum Backward Compatibility**: Added  to the  enum to handle existing database entries.
        8.  **Authentication**: Confirmed  endpoint functionality for JWT token validation.

<current_work>
The most recent work addressed a critical user complaint regarding client search filters and new client creation. The user reported that filter dropdowns (Sub Agenzia, Tipologia Contratto, Status, Utente Creatore) were not displaying *all* available system-wide options, but only those already linked to existing clients. This also impacted the creation of new clients, which couldn't find available commesse (chains). A related issue was the presence of hardcoded, non-existent typology data in the filter options.

The AI engineer successfully diagnosed and resolved these issues by:
1.  **Refactoring the  endpoint in **: The logic was changed from aggregating options based solely on existing client data to dynamically querying all unique values directly from their respective primary database collections (e.g., , ). This ensures that all available system-wide options are presented in the filters.
2.  **Removing fictitious data**: The  generation in the  endpoint was corrected to exclusively fetch real data from the database, eliminating previously hardcoded and non-existent entries.

Backend tests after these changes confirmed 100% success, verifying that filter options now accurately reflect all available data within the system and that no incorrect, hardcoded data is returned.
