The AI engineer's work focused on expanding and refining the Nureal CRM. Initial tasks involved debugging client creation (422 errors due to empty strings for enum fields) and correctly handling Offerte display/filtering in , including adding Offerta SIM to Convergenza items. Subsequent efforts addressed a  data misalignment in the .

Key feature additions included: implementing conditional Dati Mobile fields when Mobile is in  (requiring backend model updates and complex frontend conditional rendering), adding Telepass functionality with an OBU field, and overhauling the client list preview and advanced filters for dynamic updates and comprehensive status display. A major  rewrite was performed to show all client details, with several iterations to re-add conditional logic and display offer names.

The Excel export functionality was completely rebuilt to handle multiple SIMs (convergenza and mobile) per client as separate rows, including all fields and offer names. Most recently, a comprehensive Analytics section was introduced with Pivot Analytics and Sub Agenzie tabs. The engineer is currently debugging an  error, specifically related to  being called within fetch functions in the  component. The process has been highly iterative, with frequent user feedback driving continuous refinement and bug fixes.

The Nureal CRM requires robust client and project management, featuring a multi-step cascading selection for client creation, conditional field visibility, and role-based access. User management includes mandatory password changes. The client creation form has extensive fields like Ragione Sociale for Business, Codice Pod for Energia Fastweb, and nested Convergenza items.

All client data must be exportable to Excel, with each associated SIM (convergenza or mobile) generating a separate row, including all client fields (even empty ones) and the SIM's offer name. The client modification form mirrors creation logic, displays all fields, makes organizational fields read-only, shows activated offers, includes Note Back Office, displays full credit card numbers, and uses updated client statuses. Offerte must be user-creatable, dynamically linked to the full cascading filiera, and visible/editable in client forms.

New requirements added during development include:
- Displaying all Convergenza SIM data in .
- Adding Dati Mobile fields (Telefono da portare, ICCID, Operatore, Titolare se diverso) when Mobile is in , mutually exclusive with Telefonia Fastweb.
- Adding a Telepass section with an OBU field, mutually exclusive with other conditional sections.
- Redefining client list columns in the Clienti preview.
- Ensuring all advanced filters (Status, Commessa, Servizi, Tipologie Contratto) are dynamic and update automatically.
- Implementing an Analytics section with Pivot tables (multi-select, date range filter, export to Excel) and a Sub Agenzie comparative analysis, with improved UI.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing an  error in the  component. This error, , appears in the console, specifically pointing to calls within  (App.js:7021:1) and related fetch functions (, ).

The problem has been identified as  (or similar hook logic) being invoked inside these asynchronous data fetching functions, which are not direct function components. The immediate task is to remove or refactor these  calls to comply with React's Rules of Hooks. This likely involves replacing them with  for debugging purposes or passing the  function as a parameter if it needs to be called from these helpers.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Remove the  calls from the , , and  functions in .
